# Welcome to [Jupyter-JSC](https://jupyter.jsc.fz-juelich.de)

[Jupyter-JSC](https://jupyter.jsc.fz-juelich.de) is an interactive, browser-based platform designed to provide seamless access to both **supercomputing** and **cloud resources** from the JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Centre (JSC). Whether you are working on large-scale simulations, machine learning models, or data analytics, Jupyter-JSC gives you the flexibility to perform these tasks interactively through familiar Jupyter Notebooks. 

For users with HPC accounts, you can harness the power of JSC's supercomputers like [**JUWELS**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/systems/supercomputers/juwels), [**JEDI**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/systems/supercomputers/jedi), [**JURECA**](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/systems/supercomputers/jureca) and more. Additionally, **users without HPC accounts** can still benefit from the platform by utilizing **JSC-Cloud resources**.

## Why Use Jupyter-JSC?

By using Jupyter-JSC, you gain access to:

### 1. **Supercomputing and Cloud Power in Your Browser**
   Jupyter-JSC connects you to world-class supercomputing systems such as **JUWELS**, **JEDI**, **JURECA** and more. But even if you don't have access to HPC resources, you can still use **JSC-Cloud**, offering scalable computing power for your workflows, including smaller data analysis tasks, web applications, and development environments.

### 2. **Easy-to-Use Interface**
   The platform uses the popular **Jupyter Notebook** interface, making it easy for users of all skill levels to interact with powerful computational resources. Whether you're using HPC resources or the cloud, you can run code, develop models, and perform analyses all from your web browser.

### 3. **Scalable Workflows**
   With Jupyter-JSC, you can start with lightweight jobs on the **JSC-Cloud** or scale up to thousands of cores and GPUs on **HPC systems** for large-scale simulations and analysis.

### 4. **Interactive Development**
   Develop and test code interactively with instant feedback, enabling fast iteration of data science workflows, simulations, and machine learning models. You can choose between the **HPC infrastructure** or the **cloud** based on your project's needs.

### 5. **Use Custom Docker Images**
   Jupyter-JSC supports **custom Docker images**, meaning you can define and use your own computing environment. This flexibility allows you to pre-install specific dependencies, configure your environment exactly as needed, and run reproducible computational workflows across multiple sessions.

### 6. **GitHub-Based Environment with Binder**
   Through **repo2docker** integration, Jupyter-JSC allows you to use the **mybinder.org** infrastructure to build Docker images directly from your GitHub repositories. This feature enables you to turn a GitHub repo into a fully functional environment without manually building Docker images, making your code and environment highly portable and shareable.

### 7. **Access to Specialized Libraries and Tools**
   Jupyter-JSC provides pre-configured environments with libraries optimized for both **HPC** and **cloud** use cases, including scientific computing and machine learning tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.

## Use Cases

Jupyter-JSC is ideal for:

- **Large-Scale Simulations**: Use HPC resources for complex simulations in fields such as physics, engineering, and climate science.
- **Machine Learning**: Train machine learning models at scale using cloud or HPC resources.
- **Data Science and Analytics**: Analyze and visualize large datasets interactively, leveraging cloud or HPC depending on your requirements.
- **Scientific Research**: From bioinformatics to materials science, accelerate your research using cloud or supercomputing resources.
- **Workshops and Training**: Jupyter-JSC is a great platform for **hands-on workshops and training sessions**. Instructors can create custom environments, share notebooks, and guide participants through interactive coding exercises on both cloud and HPC infrastructure. This makes it ideal for educational and professional development settings.
